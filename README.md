# Movie Recommender System

## Project Overview
The Movie Recommender System is an end-to-end machine learning project that provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and historical data. This project utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to suggest movies that users are likely to enjoy. By implementing this system, I aimed to enhance user experience and engagement in movie selection.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Utilized the PMDB 500 Movie Dataset, which includes detailed information about movies, such as metadata and credits.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and merging datasets effectively.
- **Recommendation Algorithms**: Implemented both content-based and collaborative filtering algorithms to generate movie recommendations based on user behavior and movie attributes.
- **Web Application Development**: Developed a user-friendly web interface that allows users to interact with the recommendation system seamlessly.
- **Deployment**: Deployed the application on a cloud platform to make it accessible to users.
